# Path Finding Visualizer
This project is based on Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest possible path between a starting node and a target node using a Python module called PyGame. The starting and target nodes, along with the blocking nodes or walls, can be set by the user and the shortest path between them, ignoring all the intermediate walls, will be auto-generated by the program.
